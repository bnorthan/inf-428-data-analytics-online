## Course Goals


1. Utilize software such as KNIME and Anaconda (Python) to load data, calculate descriptive statistics and perform significance tests 
2. Perform online searches to quickly locate instructions, tutorials and trouble shooting tips to help solve common technical issues you may face when doing data analysis. 
3. Generate visualizations based on real world data sets.
4. Make conclusions about a topic based on a combination of visualizations. 
5. Create applications and workflows that use statistical and machine learning methods.

## My Expectations of you

1.  My main expectation of you is that you make extensive use of the Black Board 'Ask a Question' discussion.  If you encounter technical problems installing and using software report these immediately on the discussion.   If there are concepts you don't understand please bring it up on the discussion as soon as possible.  
2.  I expect you have access to a computer that you can install the class software on.  
a) Please note, I will support technical questions about Windows and Linux but do not own a MAC.  If you need to troubleshoot issues with a MAC please post on the class discussion forum.  In the face to face version of the class students with MACs helped each other troubleshoot, I expect the same in the online class via the discussion board.    

## What you can expect of me

1.  I am extremely lenient with second chances as long as you clearly communicate any difficulties you are having early and often.  For example if you have trouble installing software needed for an assignment I will almost always give you an extension, as long as you report those problems on the class discussion board a few days before a due date. 
2.  Plagarism.  Please refer to the University policies on plagarism.  Learning from online examples is OK, as long they are referenced and re-implemented for your own purposes.  Handing in an unmodified online example is not permissable.  
b) Helping each other is OK but handing in the exact same work is not. 

## Computers

Assignments require access to a laptop or desktop.
