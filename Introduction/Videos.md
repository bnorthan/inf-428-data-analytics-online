# 2021

2021 is the second year INF428/528 has been taught online.  The course continues to evolve.  We will re-use some of the videos from last year as needed, and I will produce new videos based on questions I get.  So please, if you have any questions post right away to the "ask a question" forum.  If the question can't be answered concisely it will become a video.

# 2020

2020 is the first year INF428/528 has been taught online, and it has been a learning experience for myself as to the best way to teach material.  I have been adding videos as needed based on questions I get.  I will continue to do so (if you are struggling with something ask, and I will make a video) and summarize them here.   

Oh yeah... to top it all off, all of a sudden we also got hit by a pandemic and everybody's life got disrupted a bit (this class was online anyway so I guess we've been disrupted less than others).  Stay safe.
